    	<p>Welcome! Thank you for showing interest in EVOLVR</p>
        <p>
            As part of taking EECS 493 at the University of Michigan, <br />
            our team was tasked with a semester project. This website <br />
            helps provide information on that project<br />
            <br />
        	Our team here at EVOLVR decided to take the inovations <br />
            that smartphones have provided us and use them to do <br />
            something fun! The end result was a location based <br />
            Pacman game
